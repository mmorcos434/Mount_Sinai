THINGS TO DO:

1. CHATBOT FUNCTIONALITY
- answer questions how to prep for a procedure
- check for which locations offer the desired procedure
- answer questions about insurance prices
 

2. DATA MODIFIABILITY
- authorized users need a way to be able to change the data 
- these changes need to be reflected in the dataset the chatbot uses

3. SECURITY 
- secure login for Mt Sinai employees
